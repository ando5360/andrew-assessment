Hello, 

My name is Andy and Im from Doncaster, UK. At 24 years old I see myself as a young creator entering the creative active stage, of hopefully a long and prosperous career, my experience has allowed me to curate attributes that I think make me suitable for this role. I have been assigned the following task as part of a pre-screening assessment, this repo contains my solution incorporating all aspects of the brief below. All the docs related to my solution can be found under the wiki tab on this github project, 
Please bear in mind I have time constraints as Im working full time ate the minute, this was done on the weekend to the best of my ability. However it is not as shiny as I would like 

I hope you enjoy :blush: . My solution is as follows ...
